# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind making a prework study guide was to expose myself to programming before even beginning the class. I wanted to be able to hit the ground running on this class without having to catch up to my peers. 
- The reason I built this project was to gain a bit of exposure to a new way of thinking, specifically programming languages. I don't have any experience so this was good practice into what programming will be like.
- This provides me a good place to write down notes I take during class, all while constantly being exposed to programming languages. It provides me a good place to practice. 
- I learned the basics to multiple programming languages, and the basics to creating a website.

## Usage

Each section of the prework study guide contains notes covering 4 different languages (git, javascript, css, and HTML). If we open the DevTools in Chrome we can see that the JavaScrit is running. The DevTools in Chrome will list the topics we learned in the prework study guide and randomly choose one for you to study.
